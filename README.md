1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
   2. Manually run them locally before pushing code
   3. Run them all after all development is completed

    Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. By doing so, developers could compile, build, and publish codes more efficiently.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

    No
